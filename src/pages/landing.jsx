            Are you a homeowner who needs to leave town but wants to make sure your pets and home are taken care of
            while you're away? Are you a sitter who wants an easy way to keep track of all the information you need to
            provide top-quality care? Sit Savvy has you covered!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sit Savvy is the ultimate tool for managing pet and house sitting arrangements. With Sit Savvy, homeowners
            can create detailed care plans for their pets and homes, complete with all the information sitters need to
